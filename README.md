This is the project I made for my "Lenguajes de Marca" class, a simple website where I talk about some of my favourite authors and books (I could only manage to include 2 of them for now, more to come in the future hopefully).


Credits for the sources used for this project:
https://w3schools.com/ - A helpful general resource for all html-css utilities.
https://icons.getbootstrap.com/ - Icons of the header.
https://stackoverflow.com/ - All random issues I've had.
https://css.tricks.com/ - For their flex tutorials and resources.
https://wikipedia.com - For all descriptions and long texts.
https://wpdean.com/ - For some CSS integrations.

And many youtube tutorials that I cannot find individually.
