            Told in Kvothe's own voice, this is the tale of the magically gifted young man who grows to be the most notorious wizard his world has ever seen.

The intimate narrative of his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, his years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-ridden city, his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a legendary school of magic, and his life as a fugitive after the murder of a king form a gripping coming-of-age story unrivaled in recent literature.

            The Name of the Wind is long, it's a teenage boy fantasy and it's protagonist is capable hero. Those points are its greatest strengths and its weakest links. Whether or not you are a fan of fantasy, this series is one of the most engaging, perfectly crafted character studies I have ever read. Even if you think these points make it weak, it is still worth reading for the simple act of examination. But without any work on your part, Patrick Rothfuss will thrust you deep into a world that is new, fresh, and above all, fantastic.          
          
          In short, if you love a good fantasy book, you have nothing to lose on this read!
